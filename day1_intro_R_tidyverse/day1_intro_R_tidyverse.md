Description of the dataset
========================================================
incremental: true
type: lineheight



participants viewed a
total of nine mock adverts over three sessions. In these adverts there were three products (a brand
of beer, a brand of wine, and a brand of water). These could be presented alongside positive,
negative or neutral imagery. Over the three sessions and nine adverts, each type of product was
paired with each type of imagery (read the previous chapter if you need more detail). After each
advert participants rated the drinks on a scale ranging from –100 (dislike very much) through 0
(neutral) to 100 (like very much). The design, thus far, has two independent variables: the type of
drink (beer, wine or water) and the type of imagery used (positive, negative or neutral). I also
took note of each person’s gender. It occurred to me that men and women might respond
differently to the products (because, in keeping with stereotypes, men might mostly drink lager
whereas women might drink wine).
