Dear students,

the specialist course "Introduction to Bayesian Statistical Modelling" will start next week. For this course, we recommend you use your personal laptop, on which you will have installed R (version 3.4.3) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

We will also use Stan via the R package 'rstan'. Detailed instructions on how to install it on your operating system can be found here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

We will use the following R packages, that can be installed directly from RStudio, copy-pasting the following command in the console:

install.packages(c("data.table", "coda", "mvtnorm", "devtools", "MASS", "ellipse", "rstan", "coda", "markdown", "mcmc", "MCMCpack", "MuMIn", "reshape2", "rmarkdown", "brms", "tidyverse", "bayesplot", "shinystan", "lme4", "viridis", "yarrr", "afex", "bootES"), dependencies = TRUE)

Slides, data, and scripts will be available on Github (from the first day of the course) following this link: https://github.com/lnalborczyk/Bayes_UGent_2018

Although a good knowledge of R was a prerequisite of registration, please find attached a short introduction to the R language, which will be necessary to understand the examples discussed during the course.

Please find below an updated version of the planning, and accept our apologies concerning the discrepancies between this planning and the initial planning. We believe the updated program is an improvement and hope you will feel the same.
